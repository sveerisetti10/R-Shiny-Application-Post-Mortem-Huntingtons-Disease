# BF_591_Final_Project

This repository includes the code for the R Shiny Application as well as the YouTube presentation. For the final project of BF 591, I developed an R Shiny application that features multiple bioinformatics processes implemented in R. The data that is used in this application derives from the "mRNA-Seq Expression profiling of human post-mortem BA9 brain tissue for Huntington's Disease and neurologically normal individuals" by Dr. Labadorf. 

The application includes 4 tabs: 
- The distinct values and distributions of sample information are important to understand before conducting analysis of corresponding sample data. This component allows the user to load and examine a sample information matrix.
- Exploring and visualizing counts matrices can aid in selecting gene count filtering strategies and understanding counts data structure. This component allows the user to choose different gene filtering thresholds and assess their effects using diagnostic plots of the counts matrix.
- Differential expression identifies which genes, if any, are implicated in a specific biological comparison. This component allows the user to load and explore a differential expression dataset.
- Visualizing individual gene counts is sometimes useful for examining or verifying patterns identified by differential expression analysis. There are many different ways of visualizing counts for a single gene. This app allows counts from an arbitrary gene to be selected and visualized broken out by a desired sample information variable.
